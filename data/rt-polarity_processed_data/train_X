a film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen
it 's a feel bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary
put it somewhere between sling blade and south of heaven , west of hell in the pantheon of billy bob 's body of work
more intellectually scary than dramatically involving
an inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle
as saccharine as it is disposable
you come away thinking not only that kate is n't very bright , but that she has n't been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly an all woman dysfunctional family deserve one another
the metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery
very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all
too much power , not enough puff
the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show
it 's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill considered notion that hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances
a cellophane pop remake of the punk classic ladies and gentlemen , the fabulous stains crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential
for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league
though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore
despite juliet stevenon 's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela 's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs
it 's tough to be startled when you 're almost dozing
his nelson 's screenplay needs some serious re working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it
it 's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through despite some first rate performances by its lead
a terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving
as it stands , crocodile hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla , which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster 's path of destruction
the thing looks like a made for home video quickie
enigma is well made , but it 's just too dry and too placid
